This directory contains all binary files needed to build software in src/.

These files will be packaged as binary and will only be used at build time.
They will not be installed on users' systems.

 - jars/ contains simple jars that will be packaged singularly
 - m2/ contains a Maven repo which artifacts will be packaged singularly
 - everything else will be packaged in one "glue" package.
