For each package you want to create, you should create a subdirectory here
named after the package Maven name like: orgId_artifactId_version.

In that directory, place all the source files "verbatim" (as checked out from
the original source repository).

You can create any other directory for your convenience here. In case of git-
tracked projects, for example, you can clone the whole repository and copy the
version you want to build in orgId_artifactId_version.

Please note that .gitignore files are honored!
