gjp – Green Java Packager's tools
===

`gjp` (pronounced _/ˈdʒiː ˈaɪ ˈd͡ʒəʊ/_) is a set of tools to ease and partially automate Linux packaging of Java projects.

The project focus is on producing rpm packages for SUSE distributions, but it is general enough to be useful even for other distributions.


## Install

Easiest install is via RubyGems:

    $ gem install gjp

## Usage

Currently available tools:
* `gjp get-pom NAME` will attempt to find a pom. `NAME` can be a jar file on your disk, a project directory, or simply a `name-version` string. `gjp` will get the pom either from the package itself or through search.maven.org using heuristic searching;
* `gjp get-source-address POM` will attempt to find the SCM Internet address of a pom.xml at the `POM` filename or URI (from the file itself or through api.github.com);
* `gjp get-source POM ADDRESS` downloads the source of a pom.xml's project from its SCM at ADDRESS;

## Source

`gjp`'s Git repo is available on GitHub, which can be browsed at:

and cloned with:

    git clone git@github.com:SilvioMoioli/gjp.git
